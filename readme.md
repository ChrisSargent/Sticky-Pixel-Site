Repo for the Sticky Pixel Website, a work in constant progress!

See the website here: http://www.stickypixel.com

# Pre Requisites:

- Node and NPM installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Gulp Installed: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-install
- Jekyll (Ruby) Installed: https://jekyllrb.com
- Bundler v1.16.3 Installed (version is important) `gem install bundler --version 1.16.3`

# Install

- Clone the repo
- run `yarn install`
- run `bundle install` to install Jekyll plugins

# Development

- Run `yarn start`. This compiles the Jekyll HTML, SASS CSS and Concats JS Files and launches a BrowserSync session so we can make live changes to the html and sass code.

# Build

- Run `yarn build`: For an optimised build which does the same as the above but with minified and autoprefixed code etc. and also critical, inlined-css.
