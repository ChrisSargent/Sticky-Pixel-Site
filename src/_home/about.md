Sticky Pixel is a design & development agency, relentless in the pursuit of creating products that help raise the competitiveness of our customers' businesses. We specialise in digital product design & build, embracing effortless user experience & beautiful interface design (UX / UI), front-end engineering, API & database (full-stack) development and a customer-first vision.

We help our customers take their ideas from their heads and turn them in to a reality. We spend time to discover who they are, what they're trying to achieve and how their current digital activities are performing. Only then do we put together a solution to address those aspirations and stay aligned with their business goals.

Based in London, we are experienced in web app development, native app development and website development across a number of industries including Fin-tech, Blockchain, Travel-tech, Retail and Entertainment.
