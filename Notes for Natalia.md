- It wasn't working because the two folders had the same name and work2 had the same name in both. I think Jekyll ignores underscores but I use it to denote if the folder should be included on the homepage or not (I think).

- Instead of having 2 files with the markdown, I'd have just one and display different parts depending on its context (e.g. if it's on the home page)
