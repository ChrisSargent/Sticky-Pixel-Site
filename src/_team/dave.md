Dave’s our Head of Product. His passion is making digital products delightful and easy to use. In a nutshell he creates the experiences for the products we ship. He feels strongly that design isn’t just a job for designers, it’s a philosophy that should permeate through any company that creates products. He loves almost all sports, and is reluctant to add at this present time (2019) that he’s a huge Manchester United fan.
