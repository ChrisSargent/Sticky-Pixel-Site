After 8 years of working in some of London’s largest Digital Marketing agencies, Luke decided to do things differently. After a growing frustration at the reluctance of agencies to adapt and evolve at the same breath-taking rate as digital technology, Luke quit his desk-job to take some time out and see the world. He used (some of) his time away to re-think exactly what made a great marketing agency in a digital world, and found that very few agencies fit the description.

With that, [Pattern Digital](https://www.patterndigitalmarketing.com/) was founded to make sure that the opportunities brought by the digital world weren’t missed. With a digital-first approach to media strategy and in-house expertise in Search Engine Marketing, Search Engine Optimization and Social Media, Luke and the team thrive on working with clients that want agile, creative solutions to their marketing needs. Which is why Pattern and Sticky Pixel work so well together!
