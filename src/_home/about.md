Sticky Pixel is a design & development agency, relentless in the pursuit of creating products that help raise the competitiveness of our customers' businesses. We specialise in digital product design & build, embracing effortless user experience & beautiful interface design (UX / UI), front-end engineering, API & database (full-stack) development and a customer-first vision.

We help our customers take their ideas from their heads and turn them in to a reality. We spend time to discover who they are, what they're trying to achieve and how their current digital activities are performing. Only then do we put together a solution to address those aspirations and stay aligned with their business goals.

We are based near Nice on the French Riviera and work on projects from all over Europe and more locally in Nice, Cannes, Monaco, Sophia Antipolis, Antibes and St Tropez. We are experienced in web app development, native app development and website development across a number of industries including Fin-tech and Travel-tech.
