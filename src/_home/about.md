Sticky Pixel is a web design & development agency, relentless in the pursuit of creating beautiful, effortless digital experiences that help raise the competitiveness of our clients' businesses. We specialise in user experience & interface (UX / UI) design & development, product development, front-end engineering and digital-marketing activities.

We pride ourselves on our focus on our clients' business goals; we spend time with you discover who you are, what you're trying to achieve and how your current digital activities are performing. Then we put together a solution to address your aspirations, combining what you need to say, who you want to say it to and how you will say it. We then measure our results and make more changes and recommendations based on those analytics.

We are based near Nice on the French Riviera and work on projects from all over Europe and more locally in Nice, Cannes, Monaco, Sophia Antipolis, Antibes and St Tropez. We are experienced in the eCommerce, travel and luxury sectors, building both applications and corporate websites.
