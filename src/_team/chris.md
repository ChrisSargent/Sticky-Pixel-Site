With a background in technology and business development, Chris has both a keen understanding of what is most important for our clients, their products and their customer but also the expertise to successfully build and manager your digital projects. He wrote his first 'code' on a BBC Basic computer - some games from a programming book - and has been building websites since 2000 (the familiar story of building one for his band!).

His passion for design has always played an important part of his life and was often drawing cars and dreaming of being an industrial designer at school. After feeding his creativity side through years of writing music and playing in hard rock bands, the digital world has now become the perfect outlet for him to bring together his product expertise, business development experience and satisfy his creative side.
