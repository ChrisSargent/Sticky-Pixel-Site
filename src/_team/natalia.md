Natalia started out creating websites for small businesses. Fast forward 8 years, and she's the one meticulously studying every detail of our designs to ensure our products look exactly as envisioned using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Natalia also studied educational psychology at PhD level - probably why she's so good at understanding the truth and logic behind our client's ideas.
