Having had them around her when she was growing up, Natalia has always had a fascination for computers and their workings. Her interest in graphic design was planted by her father, a production artist, working on type and layouts for magazines, and cultivated by her mother introducing her to the wonders of Photoshop and in particular making text look like itâ€™s on fire!

Later, whilst studying for her educational psychology degree and PhD, she started to help friends and family with various small website projects and decided to take a course on computer science at her university. This led to the realisation that she still loved computers, coding and creating amazing things! Since then, she has worked for several Moscow-based agencies on many small and large-scale web development projects, and now works with Sticky Pixel, here in the French Riviera.

**Specialties:** HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, PHP, WordPress, Photoshop, Responsive Design, Igniting Type.
